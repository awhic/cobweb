# CobWeb

From the 'About Us' page: CobWeb is a software made by CIS majors at the University of Louisville to foster an environment of mentor-ship and increase student involvement and interactions. CobWeb works by connecting CIS students to other CIS students, University of Louisville alumni, and IT Professionals. Students will be paired with a mentor and IT professionals to jump-start their networking and sense of belonging in the IT world.

This project was developed in an Agile team for the University of Louisville, College of Business course, CIS 420: CIS Development Project. This project can currently be accessed and explored in two ways:
- Hosted on [WordPress](https://cobwebmaroon6.wpcomstaging.com/) (may be either unavailable or missing plug-in features).
- Archived in this repository (will be missing features like logging in, discussion board, etc.).
  - Pull down the repository in a git bash with the below command:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/awhic/cobweb.git
      ```
  - Open the main index.html file (not in any subfolder) in your web browser. Enjoy!
